					<p>Actually rarely relevant.  I guess if you&#39;re getting swarmed by saprolings, this will cut down on the damage over time, but I used to run this and found it to really underperform.  It seems like it would be good at finishing off (or at least threatening to finish off) attackers that you were 1 point away from killing in combat, but that situation never really seemed to come up.</p>

					<p>(The Urzatron) I see so many Karn decks running this, and I really don&#39;t get it.  How many times do you actually assemble it?  Maybe 1 out of 20 games?  If these were replaced with three utility lands, how often do you think you&#39;d be activating them?  An extra 4 mana is a big deal, but it just seems like wasted potential. (As of 2024, this is probably worth running, but for weird reasons.)</p>

					<p>I&#39;m not going to review all those weird lands that don&#39;t make mana, like Safe Haven and Sorrow&#39;s Path, but I&#39;ll make an exception for Maze of Ith, which is by far the best.  Try to think of this more like a Rock Jockey than a land (we all remember that card, right?) but obviously it&#39;s tutorable with Expedition Map and stuff.</p>
					
					<p>I originally didn&#39;t even have a review for this card, since until 2016 it had never been reprinted and it was a bit pricey, plus it had that old old land frame that just never looked right, along with its gross art.  Normally I love weird, old cards, but it was also too popular and I&#39;ve always been a bit of a hipster.  Now I feel like it&#39;s almost hidden tech again.</p>
					
					<p>Fun fact: In an old issue of InQuest magazine, they had a quiz to test your Magic knowledge, and the final question was this: You have no permanents in play, no cards in your hand, and you&#39;re at 1 life.  Your opponent plays a Force of Nature.  What is the only card you could draw on your next turn to stabilize your position?</p>
					
					<p>Even funner fact: I don&#39;t think the answer has changed since then!</p>
					
					<p>Okay, almost none of that was an actual review.  I don&#39;t know, it&#39;s a great card.  Play it.  But I feel like I&#39;m giving non-land advice at this point.</p>

					<p>Powerful effect, but I haven&#39;t found it to come up all that often.  I think the deck is just so mana-hungry that a lot of the time you&#39;re better off playing your creatures normally and using your mana on other stuff.  Still, though, surprises are something that a Karn deck lacks in general, so just having this land out can make people play differently.</p>

					<p>Clearly very powerful, and with 40 life you can use it quite a bit before it starts getting prohibitive.  Still, I like to generate my extra mana the fair way: Temple of the False God.  My advice?  Save your money and don&#39;t paint a target on yourself.</p>

					<p>This may seem borderline useless, but it&#39;s not a few upsides.  Most obviously, it survives Armageddon.  But beyond that: 1) Funny combo with Seer&#39;s Sundial (which was a card I ran in 2012), but since you have to use it on your opponent&#39;s turn, you might end up drawing a land and feeling silly.  2) It&#39;s a &#34;placeholder&#34; for Vesuva.  No copy-worthy lands in play and you want to drop your Vesuva?  Just copy this and wait for a better target.  3) Tom Wänerstrand art!</p>

This was in the first draft of my Karn deck, back when there weren&#39;t even 40 lands with any upside, but I&#39;ve decided I have to leave it in until it&#39;s useful.  I don&#39;t even need to use it, I just want my opponent to be about to attack with his Looter il-Kor, look over, and say, &#34;Really!?&#34;  Only then will I feel right taking this out.</p>
					
					<p>...That&#39;s what I told myself.  But several years later, I took it out without ever having activated it.  (2023 Update: I&#39;ve given it a new home in my retro-border Karn deck!  Still never activated.)</p>

					<p>The usual use of this card (which the designers could have never foreseen) is as a repeatable Disarm, but Karn himself is pretty good at doing that (likewise unforeseen)!  Still, redundancy is never bad.  (And if you&#39;ve moved on from OG Karn, this is very much worth it.)  But even playing this straight often works out: you&#39;ll feel pretty smart when your opponent attacks you with a Wurmcoil Engine into your empty board, so you animate your Mishra&#39;s Factory and give it protection.

Fortunately, most of the lands in a Karn deck are at least sort of worth copying.  Temple of the False God seems to be what I end up copying the most.  You just can never have enough mana.</p>

					<p>This card is a real game-changer.  I&#39;d recommend at least one just so you have something to do when you get Ghost Quartered, but beyond that, we can now run cards like Sword of the Animist, Solemn Simulacrum, and Burnished Hart.  Unless you&#39;re playing a ramp deck, I can&#39;t say I recommend that strategy, since you&#39;d need to play at least five or six (maybe more if you&#39;re running the Sword).  But this card alone makes so many cards that were previously unplayable now worthy of consideration.</p>

					<p>When I first saw this card, I thought it was just a silly top-down design to highlight how &#34;Urza&#39;s&#34; and &#34;Saga&#34; are both subtypes.  I hoped it would go forgotten so I could pick up a couple for my EDH decks.  But now that it&#39;s one of the most played cards in Modern, as an obligate hipster, I kind of have to hate it.  Obviously this card is absurdly powerful, but keep in mind it does put you down a land unless you&#39;re a degenerate who runs Sol Ring.</p>

					<p>I gotta be honest, I just don&#39;t like the Dungeons &amp; Dragons crossover.  That said, this is a pretty powerful effect to have access to.  Entering tapped is a real downside, but again, so few colorless lands do that it&#39;s not a big deal.  When you compare it to Bonders&#39; Enclave, though, it starts looking much worse.  That one doesn&#39;t enter tapped, doesn&#39;t require you to tap your general, and provides a better bonus most of the time.</p>

					<p>Okay, what the frick is this?  Let&#39;s get this out of the way: &#34;Urza&#39;s&#34; should never have been a land type!  The Urzatron should have been name-based, not type-based, and as far as I know, the only reason they created the types was to make the original text work as written, but that&#39;s just not a very good reason, especially when the intent was clearly to reference the name... land types didn&#39;t even really exist when the Urzatron was printed!  And since types have to be a single word, &#34;Urza&#39;s&#34; became a type in itself, which really feels like some kind of bug in the game (don&#39;t get me started on how they had to hyphenate &#34;power-plant&#34;).  Sure, we get Urza&#39;s Saga poking fun at that, but then this card comes along and tries to pretend like it was all intentional!  And fine, sometimes Magic cards can be funny like that, but it still feels wrong.  Now, onto my actual review: this card is good.  I&#39;m personally not a big fan of the Urzatron in colorless commander, but this makes it look fairly tempting.  Urza&#39;s Factory counts too, plus Urza&#39;s Saga, of course (but that one doesn&#39;t stick around too long).  And since Metalcraft is almost always on, this will be producing at least two mana fairly regularly.  Of course, it does force you to play the Urzatron at least and probably Urza&#39;s Factory too, which aren&#39;t going to do that much by themselves.  I can&#39;t say for certain whether it&#39;s worth it, but I like cards that make you commit to the bit.</p>

And aside from poison, this also the cheapest way to make tokens on a land if you&#39;re just looking for sacrifice fodder: it&#39;s slightly ahead of Hall of Tagsin for (non-creature) artifacts and Springjack Pasture for (non-artifact) creatures, and way ahead of Urza&#39;s Factory if you want both types.  Thank God it doesn&#39;t have that gold frame, even though it can mana mana of any color!</p>

Anyway, this is strictly better, both mechanically and aesthetically, since it&#39;s a reference to the real-life Delicate Arch.  Of course, the best colorless Desert is Endless Sands, which is pretty funny since you&#39;re not always going to want to bounce that one.

					<p>Not great.  We have so many incredible card-draw effects in our lands by now that this doesn&#39;t really cut it.  I&#39;d honestly rather play Voldaren Estate.</p>

					<p>I love mentioning Swarmyard in this document, but this is no upgrade.  Obviously it costs more to activate, but this new batch of creature types is no more useful to a colorless deck.  Swarmyard cars about living things, Duneyard cars about the dead... it&#39;s like no one cares about non-living beings at all!  You might have the occasional spirit or zombie token this can work on, but the whole point of those is they&#39;re expendable.</p>

					<p>I&#39;ve complained about gold frames, I&#39;ve complained about Dungeons and Dragons, and I outright refuse to acknowledge Universes Beyond.  Well, I&#39;m not too fond of Edge of Eternities&#39;s science fiction setting (though I actually prefer it to Duskmorne&#39;s Earth-in-the-1980s level of technology, which I didn&#39;t need to acknowledge because there weren&#39;t any utility lands)... ugh, don&#39;t get me started.  Anyway, they finally made a strictly better (except for creature type) Urza&#39;s Factory.  Speaking of creature types, I still haven&#39;t warmed up to &#34;Robot&#34;, but this land is great and the art is great, and that pump ability is a little awkward but in the right situation it can be devastating.  Hard to cut this one unless you&#39;re a hardcore fantasy purist.</p>

					<p>This land is crazy in a lot of decks, but mostly for the mana fixing and tribal synergies.  It&#39;s certainly not bad, but standards for lands are so high now that, depending on what you&#39;re looking for, you&#39;re almost certainly better off playing Mutavault, Mirrex, or Secluded Starforge.</p>
