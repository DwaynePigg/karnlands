						<p>Actually rarely relevant.  I guess if you're getting swarmed by saprolings, this will cut down on the damage over time, but I used to run this and found it to really underperform.  It seems like it would be good at finishing off (or at least threatening to finish off) attackers that you were 1 point away from killing in combat, but that situation never really seemed to come up.</p>

						<p>I see so many Karn decks running this, and I really don't get it.  How many times do you actually assemble it?  Maybe 1 out of 20 games?  If these were replaced with three utility lands, how often do you think you'd be activating them?  An extra 4 mana is a big deal, but it just seems like wasted potential. (As of 2024, this is probably worth running, but for weird reasons.)</p>

						<p>I'm not going to review all those weird lands that don't make mana, like <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/DRK/118">Safe Haven</a> and <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/DRK/119">Sorrow's Path</a>, but I'll make an exception for <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/DRK/117">Maze of Ith</a>, which is by far the best.  Try to think of this more like a <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/SCG/101">Rock Jockey</a> than a land (we all remember that card, right?) but obviously it's tutorable with <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/ZEN/201">Expedition Map</a> and stuff.</p><p>I originally didn't even have a review for this card, since until 2016 it had never been reprinted and it was a bit pricey, plus it had that old old land frame that just never looked right, along with its gross art.  Normally I love weird, old cards, but it was also too popular and I've always been a bit of a hipster.  Now I feel like it's almost hidden tech again.</p><p>Fun fact: In an old issue of InQuest magazine, they had a quiz to test your Magic knowledge, and the final question was this: You have no permanents in play, no cards in your hand, and you're at 1 life.  Your opponent plays a <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/LEA/194">Force of Nature</a>.  What is the only card you could draw on your next turn to stabilize your position?</p><p>Even funner fact: I don't think the answer has changed since then!</p><p>Okay, almost none of that was an actual review.  I don't know, it's a great card.  Play it.  But I feel like I'm giving non-land advice at this point.</p>

I think the deck is just so mana-hungry that a lot of the time you're better off playing your creatures normally and using your mana on other stuff.  Still, though, surprises are something that a Karn deck lacks in general, so just having this land out can make people play differently.</p>

But beyond that: 1) Funny combo with <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/WWK/130">Seer's Sundial</a> (which was a card I ran in 2012), but since you have to use it on your opponent's turn, you might end up drawing a land and feeling silly.  2) It's a "placeholder" for <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/TSP/281">Vesuva</a>.  No copy-worthy lands in play and you want to drop your <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/TSP/281">Vesuva</a>?  Just copy this and wait for a better target.  3) Tom Wänerstrand art!</p>

Still, redundancy is never bad.  (And if you've moved on from OG Karn, this is very much worth it.)  But even playing this straight often works out: you'll feel pretty smart when your opponent attacks you with a <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/SOM/223">Wurmcoil Engine</a> into your empty board, so you animate your <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/ATQ/80a">Mishra's Factory</a> and give it protection.

Unless you're playing a ramp deck, I can't say I recommend that strategy, since you'd need to play at least five or six (maybe more if you're running the Sword).

						<p>It's cool that there's a way to get the monarch ball rolling in a colorless deck, and the fact that it's attached to a land, rather than a weak artifact creature, is a nice bonus.  In one-on-one, you can wait until you're in a defensive position, and in multiplayer you can use the crown as a diversion (as long as you're willing to take a hit first).</p>

						<p>Okay, what the frick is this?  Let's get this out of the way: "Urza's" should never have been a land type!  The Urzatron should have been name-based, not type-based, and as far as I know, the only reason they created the types was to make the original text work as written, but that's just not a very good reason, especially when the intent was clearly to reference the name... land types didn't even really exist when the Urzatron was printed!  And since types have to be a single word, "Urza's" became a type in itself, which really feels like some kind of bug in the game (don't get me started on how they had to hyphenate "power-plant").  Sure, we get <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/MH2/259">Urza's Saga</a> poking fun at that, but then this card comes along and tries to pretend like it was all intentional!  And fine, sometimes Magic cards can be funny like that, but it still feels wrong.</p><p>Now, onto my actual review: this card is good.  I'm personally not a big fan of the Urzatron in colorless commander, but this makes it look fairly tempting.  <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/TSP/280">Urza's Factory</a> counts too, plus <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/MH2/259">Urza's Saga</a>, of course (but that one doesn't stick around too long).  And since Metalcraft is almost always on, this will be producing at least two mana fairly regularly.  Of course, it does force you to play the Urzatron at least and probably <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/TSP/280">Urza's Factory</a> too, which aren't going to do that much by themselves.  I can't say for certain whether it's worth it, but I like cards that make you commit to the bit.</p>

						<p>The tokens can't block, which is the main reason you'd want to make a single 1/1 in EDH.  But opening up an alternate win condition (backed up by <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/WAR/248">Karn's Bastion</a> and maybe <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/SOM/145">Contagion Engine</a>) is pretty serious.  Yes, <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/MBS/145">Inkmoth Nexus</a> is a better card overall, but this one does play better against removal if you're really trying to land a hit.  And aside from poison, this also the cheapest way to make tokens on a land if you're just looking for sacrifice fodder: it's slightly ahead of <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/BRO/263">Hall of Tagsin</a> for (non-creature) artifacts and <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/EVE/179">Springjack Pasture</a> for (non-artifact) creatures, and way ahead of <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/TSP/280">Urza's Factory</a> if you want both types.

						<p>My God, we're hitting a critical mass of crazy lands.  I recently just cut <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/BRO/263">Hall of Tagsin</a>, a land that I would have gone nuts for if I'd seen it back in 2011.  There's not much to say here: this land is obviously built for artifact decks and sometimes you'll be looking at so many cards it might as well be a repeatable <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/KLD/247">Inventors' Fair</a>.</p>

						<p>There's basically no payoff for having a full snow manabase, but there is one advantage this has: <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/M20/247">Field of the Dead</a>.  I like the idea of having a perfect singleton deck (mostly for its own aesthetic value), but you probably should be playing at least a couple basics in anticipation of <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/XLN/254">Field of Ruin</a> and <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/CON/15">Path to Exile</a>.

This can remove an attacker or save one of your own creatures, and it's perfect for the 2023 Karn since it'll phase him back in just in time for your mana boost.  It's pseudo-ramp, too, though it takes you from 4 to 6, so it's rarely that big of a deal.  Also, another good instant-speed land with <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/MH3/234">Urza's Cave</a>.</p>

Anyway, they finally made a strictly better (except for creature type) <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/TSP/280">Urza's Factory</a>.  Speaking of creature types, I still haven't warmed up to "Robot", but this land is great and the art is great, and that pump ability is a little awkward but in the right situation it can be devastating.  Hard to cut this one unless you're a hardcore fantasy purist.</p>
